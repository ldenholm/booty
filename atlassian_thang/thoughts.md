I feel this went well. Genuinely I felt like I explained my thinking
and solutions along the way. Communicated my ideas with the interviewer
and checked with them if the ideas made sense. I asked questions to
refine the problem scope. I wrote some elementary tests that
provided success and failure behaviour. I am puzzled why the rejection
came so quickly but at least it feels completely out of my control. It
will be interesting to see what the feedback is and if it's just bollocks.
I guess the fact of the matter is: I know I can program and I work on 
tough problems at work. I'm going to give myself the benefit of the doubt
and not let this experience determine my self worth. I'm also going to
concentrate on systems programming the first half of this year to improve
my skills. Still not 100% decided if I will take prob & stats semester 1
or 2.

P.s. just some extra thoughts... I'm not a robot and it takes time
for me to consider a problem and how to tackle it. I don't know why
these programming interviews place such emphasis on producing
output in such a harsh time constraint. It doesn't really simulate
a real-world programming environment at all. Like people are not sitting
there smashing out non-stop prod features with no time to reflect or
consider if they are any good or even worth it. I know it's important
to not take these things personally, but in all fairness it is hard to 
have these cold standoff-ish 'interviews' with the subtext 
"prove to me you are worthy" and not to feel like you have failed.
Regardless of 'failing' that, I feel like I accomplished something good,
and I'm going to choose to take it as a learning experience reject harbouring
self-doubt.
